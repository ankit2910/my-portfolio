        <p>
          I'm Ankit Kumar, a final year undergrad from National Institute of 
          Technology, Rourkela. I love to solve problems and learn and build new 
          exciting things. I am a skilled full stack web developer and have proficient 
          in some tech stacks like MERN stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being creative and perpetual learner by heart, motivates me to pursue software development.
          The role will give the opportunity to dive deep into software development and learn 
          continuously in the dynamic environment. I get myself ready to embrace obstacles and find 
          solutions to any issues that may come up while learning through any medium.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done several self projects, and each one brought me to learn new things.
          I always like to learn new stuffs and building things with them.
